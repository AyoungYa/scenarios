# Git Configuration

If you want to use git with your GitHub account, you need to configure git to work with your GitHub account. Let's do it.

## Configure Git

To configure git, you need to provide your GitHub username and email address. To do this, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git config --global user.name "your_username"
git config --global user.email "your_email"
```

> You can use any username and email address. However, it is recommended to use the same username and email address that you used to create your GitHub account.
