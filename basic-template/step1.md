# Heading for Step 1

For the most part, challenges and labs are very similar. The main difference is that challenges are designed to be completed by students, while labs include the learning steps.

## Lab Example

Let's create a new file called `bananas.txt`.

```bash
touch bananas.txt
```

Now create another file, but this time called `apples.txt`.

```bash
touch apples.txt
```

> The lab contains complete teaching steps for students to learn.

## Challenge Example

Create new files called `bananas.txt` and `apples.txt`.

> The challenge includes only the objectives that the students need to accomplish on their own.
