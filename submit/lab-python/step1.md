# Python Datatype - Number and String

Python is a **dynamically-typed** language, which means that the type of a variable is determined at runtime, rather than being fixed at compile time. Python has a number of built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and strings.

There are six standard data types in Python3:

- Number
- String (string)
- List (list)
- Tuple
- Set (collection)
- Dictionary

Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, and 3. Floating-point numbers, also known as floats, are numbers with decimal points, such as 1.5 and 3.14. Booleans are binary values that can be either True or False. All these **types of number** is dynamically-typed in the python.


```python
a = 1
b = 1.5
c = -0.23478
```

Strings are sequences of characters, such as "hello" and "goodbye". They can be defined by using single quotes or double quotes.

```python
d = 'hello'
e = "goodbye"
```
