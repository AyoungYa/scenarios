# Python Datatype - List

In addition to the mentioned basic data types, Python also has a number of compound data types, such as **lists, tuples, set and dictionaries**. These data types allow you to store and manipulate more complex data structures in your programs.

Overall, Python's built-in data types provide a rich set of tools for working with data in your programs. Understanding these data types and how to use them effectively is an important part of becoming a proficient Python programmer. Let's start from list.

## List

In Python, a list is a collection of data that is ordered and changeable. It is similar to an array in other programming languages, but it is more flexible, as it allows you to store data of different types in the same list.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
```

This creates a list with three elements: 1, 2, and 3. These elements can be accessed using their index, with the first element having an index of 0. For example:

```python
print(my_list[0]) # prints 1
print(my_list[1]) # prints 2
print(my_list[2]) # prints 3
```

Lists in Python are dynamic and can be modified after they are created. Elements can be added, removed, or changed, and the length of the list can be changed. This makes them a powerful tool for working with data in Python.
