# Class and method

There is a class called `Shape` which has a property named `length` and a public method called `area()` for calculating the area. The `length` is passed in through the constructor when the object is created. At this step, calling `area()` is not completed and will raise a `NotImplementedError` exception when called.

## TODO

- Completing `shape.py`

## Requirements

- Please implement the `Shape` class, which takes a length parameter in the constructor.
- Write an `area()` method of `shape` class that raises a NotImplementedError when called.
