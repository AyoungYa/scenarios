# Fibonacci Numbers Generator

Write a function (fibonacci(n)) that takes an integer as input and returns a generator that yields the first Fibonacci numbers.Fibonacci number is defined as:

```scss
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
```

## TODO

- Completing `fibonacci.py`

## Requirements

   - The function should take an integer n as input, where n is the     number of Fibonacci numbers to generate.
   - The function should return a generator that yields the first n Fibonacci numbers.
   - The generator should not store the entire list of Fibonacci numbers in memory. Instead, it should yield each Fibonacci number one at a time.
