# Time-Consuming Statistics

Through the above two steps, we parsed the log file and summarized the number of requests for each uri. In this step, we need to find and return the uri that takes the maximum and the minimum time on average.

## Tips

- Counting sum value using built-in functions `sum()`.
- The second value parsed from each log line is a string, which needs to be converted to a numeric type.

## TODO

- Completing `time_statistics.py`

## Requirements

- Finish your code in `time_statistics` function.
