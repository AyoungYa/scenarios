# Time-Consuming Statistics

Through the above two steps, we parsed the log file and summarized the number of requests for each uri. In this step, we need to find and print out the uri that takes the most and the least time on average. The following is the execution command:

```bash
python ~/solution_3.py

```

## Tips

- Counting averages using built-in functions `sum()`.
- The second value parsed from each log line is a string, which needs to be converted to a numeric type.

## TODO

- Completing `log_parsing.py`

## Requirements
