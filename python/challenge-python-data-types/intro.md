# Hello Python

One potential challenge exercise for Python data types is to create a program that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa. The program should prompt the user for a temperature and a unit (C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit), and then convert the temperature to the other unit and display the result.

For example, if the user enters "32C", the program should convert this temperature to Fahrenheit and display the result: "32C is 89.6F". If the user enters "89.6F", the program should convert this temperature to Celsius and display the result: "89.6F is 32C".
