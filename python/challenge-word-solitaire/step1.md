# Sentence input and split

Please write a piece of code that can accept an English sentence as input, split the sentence string into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter, and perform the following operations:

- Keep only the words containing letters, remove punctuation, digits, and words with non-letter characters.
- Convert all letters to lowercase.
- Remove duplicates, leaving only one occurrence of each word.
  Here is an example:

```bash
Please enter an English sentenceï¼šIsn't it a pleasure to study and practice what you have learned?

output: ['it', 'a', 'pleasure', 'to', 'study', 'and', 'practice', 'what', 'you', 'have', 'learned']

```
