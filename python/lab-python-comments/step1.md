# Single Line Comments

Python uses `#` for single-line comments. It can be at the top of the code line or the end of the code line.

Now you can open `single.py` in your text editor and add a single-line comment.

## Example

```python
# Output hello string
print('hello')
```

or

```python
print('hello') # Output hello string
```
