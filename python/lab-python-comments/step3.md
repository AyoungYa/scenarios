# Multi Line Comments

Let's start trying to write adding code comments.

## Add a Single Line Comment

Open `single.py` in your text editor and add single-line comments:

```python
# Output hello string.
print("hello")
```

## Add Multi-Line Comments

Open `multi.py` in your text editor and add multi-line comments:

```python
'''
Output world string.
'''
print("world")
```
