# Sum and Sorted

There are some baskets, each containing fruits of different weights. Please calculate the total weight of fruits in each basket, and return them in order.

example of input:
```
{
    "apple": [1, 2.3, 4, 5],
    "orange": [3],
    "banana": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

return value example:
```
[{"name": "banana", "weight": 15}, {"name": "apple", "weight": 12.3}, {"name": "orange", "weight": 3}]
```

## TODO

- Completing `basket_weight.py`

## Requirements

- If the number of basket is 0, return empty list.
- The returned results must be sorted by weight from largest to smallest.
