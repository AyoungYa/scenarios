# Sum and Sorted

There are three baskets, one basket contains apples, another contains watermelons, and the other contains bananas, their weight are:

```python
apple = [1, 2.3, 4, 5]
orange = [3, 4.4, 5.5, 0.4, 0.6, 1.2, 3.2]
banana = [4, 5, 6]
```

Please calculate the weight of the fruits in each basket and output in descending order with the following format:

```bash
basket_name1: weight1, basket_name2: weight2...
```
