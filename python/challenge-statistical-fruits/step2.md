# Put Fruit into basket

There is a basket that can hold 10 of fruit.
You are to input the weight of the fruit from the command line and put it in the basket. When the total weight is greater than 10, return the total weight as string and fruit list that have been put in the basket.

Here is the input example:

```bash
Enter the weight of the fruit: 2
Enter the weight of the fruit: hello
Enter the weight of the fruit: 5.354
Enter the weight of the fruit: 3

# return value
7.35, [2, 5.354]
```

## TODO

- Completing `put_fruits.py`

## Requirements

- If the input value is not a numerical value or less than 0, skip it directly.
- The return value of total weight must round to two decimal places.
