# Put Fruit into basket

There is a basket that can hold 10kg of fruit.
You are to input the weight of the fruit from the command line and put it in the basket. When the total weight is greater than 10, output the total weight of the fruits that have been put in the basket and end the program. Note: the input values can be decimal numbers, and the final output should be formatted with two decimal places.
Here is the input example:

```bash
Enter the weight of the fruit: 2
Enter the weight of the fruit: 9
The basket is full. Total weight: 11.00kg
```
